/** YouTube explanation of for-loop: https://youtu.be/mTRCf0zXAp4
 * 
 * Task:
 * Look back to Exercise 32 - The sum of a set of numbers from Chapter 11
 * If you didn't complete this assignment, choose one nearby that used loops
 * We completed this assignment using a while-loop (most likely).
 * Re-code this assignment using a for-loop. How can we translate our ideas from while-loops to for-loops?
